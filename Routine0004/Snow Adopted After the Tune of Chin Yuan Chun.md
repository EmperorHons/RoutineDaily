Snow Adopted After the Tune of Chin Yuan Chun
               沁园春·雪
            文：Mao Zedong

North country scene,
    北国风光，

A hundred leagues locked in ice,
        千里冰封，

A thousand leagues of whirling snow.
        万里雪飘。

Both sides of the Great Wall
        望长城内外，

One single white immensity.
        惟余莽莽；

The Yellow River's swift current
        大河上下，

Is stilled from end to end.
        顿失滔滔。

The mountains dance like silver snakes
        山舞银蛇，

And the highlands charge like wax-hued elephants,
        原驰蜡象，

Vying with heaven in stature.
        欲与天公试比高。

On a fine day, the land,
        须晴日，

Clad in white, adorned in red,
        看红装素裹，

Grows more enchanting.
        分外妖娆。

This land so rich in beauty
        江山如此多娇，

Has made countless heroes bow in homage.
        引无数英雄竞折腰。

But alas! Chin Shih-huang and Han Wu-ti
        惜秦皇汉武，

Were lacking in literary grace,
        略输文采；

And Tang Tai-tsung and Sung Tai-tsu
        唐宗宋祖，

Had little poetry in their souls;
        稍逊风骚。

And Genghis Khan, Proud Son of Heaven for a day,
        一代天骄，成吉思汗，

Knew only shooting eagles, bow outstretched
        只识弯弓射大雕。

All are past and gone!
        俱往矣，

For truly great men
    数风流人物，

Look to this age alone.
    还看今朝。
