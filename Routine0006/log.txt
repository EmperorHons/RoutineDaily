There's A New Kid In Town (Album Version)
We're looking for the king
The new messiah
We're following the star shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose  heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in bethlehem
I see you&apos;ve traveled far
Bearing tresures
You say these gifts are for the new kings pleasure
I&apos;ve heard that a king might come
But up till now there hasn't been one
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose  heaven knows
There's a new kid in townHere in bethlehem
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose  heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in bethlehem
